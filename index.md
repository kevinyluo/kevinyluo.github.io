Fully interactive and dynamic block world. The goal of this project was to create a world with realistic lighting and textures. All objects are constructed using webGL triangles, and the lighting is calculated using the diffuse lighting model. The project incorporated the following technologies:

- WebGL
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

A mobile app for making decisions when in a group. Create a lobby and get your friends to join. Select categories for restuarants you're interested in (from yelp) and start swiping. At the end, the restuarant with the most "votes" will be displayed, so you decide where to eat. I developed the back-end REST API for this project using `JavaScript`.The following technologies were used to run the application:

- flutter (front-end)
- AWS (to run the server)
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB

A `react` webpage for creating and visualizing graph structures. I am adding algorithms to run on the graphs, which will show how algorithms work, and will display the outcome of the algorithm. The graphics are created using `react-konva` and `react bootstrap`. This project is work in progress, and I hope to incorporate the following features in the future:

- [x] undirected graphs
- [x] add and remove nodes and edges
- [ ] directed graphs
- [ ] custom node labels
- [ ] algorithm visualization
- [ ] force layout option
